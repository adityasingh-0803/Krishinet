# ðŸŒ¾ KrishiNet
**Decentralized Multi-Agent System for Agricultural Trade**  
_Developed for AI Agents Summit 2025 by Team Hashira_

---

## ðŸ§  Overview

**KrishiNet** is a decentralized simulation platform where autonomous AI agents represent farmers, buyers, and transport providers. These agents negotiate crop deals, simulate delivery logistics, and emulate payments using a tokenization logic â€” all visualized through a React dashboard.

Built to explore the future of **agent-to-agent (A2A) economies** on decentralized rails, KrishiNet demonstrates how AI agents can power agricultural markets in rural India.
